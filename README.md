# OPTIMIZATION-MODEL

ðŸšš Delivery Route Optimization using Linear Programming ðŸ“Œ Project Description This project demonstrates how to solve a real-world logistics problem using linear programming with the PuLP library in Python. The goal is to minimize delivery costs while meeting customer demand across cities and staying within truck capacity limits.

ðŸ“¦ Problem Statement A logistics company delivers packages to multiple cities using a limited number of trucks. Each truck has a maximum capacity, and each city has a fixed demand for packages. The company wants to determine the optimal number of packages each truck should deliver to each city to minimize total delivery cost.

âœ… Features Linear programming model using PuLP

Customizable demand, truck capacities, and distances

Optimal cost calculation

Distribution plan output for each truck
